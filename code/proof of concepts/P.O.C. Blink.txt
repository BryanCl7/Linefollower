  Turning a LED on and off with a delay of one second.
  Most Arduinos have an on-board LED. On the UNO, MEGA, leonardo and ZERO
  it is connected to pin 13. On tinkercad I used an off-board LED.I used pin 8 to control the LED
 */  
int led = 8;//you can change pin 8 to whichever pin you chose to control the LED
// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
  pinMode(led, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(1, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);                       // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(1, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);                       // wait for a second
}
